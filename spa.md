Create and bootstrap a Single Page Application using either Vue.js or React.js and create a public repo either on github
or gitlab for the app, named spa-swapi-test (or something similar). Have a look on https://swapi.dev/ which is a public
HTTP web API and proceed with applying to your code the following actions, along with the appropriate commits.

1.  Create a layout for the app which will consist of the **logo**, the **main-navigation**, the **main-view** and a
    **sub-view**. Choose a css framework of your preference.
2.  Create the **main-nav** which consists of the Films(home route) and the People.
3.  Create the **main-view** which should list all the selected route's resources with their attributes(only the
    non-array).
4.  Create a **sub-view** which, when an item from the main view is clicked, will show the item's array attributes and
    their resources count (e.g. when /film/1 is clicked there will be 12 characters, 2 species etc. ).
5.  Create a button which exports in csv format all the Planets (only the non-array fields) in Wookiee language.
